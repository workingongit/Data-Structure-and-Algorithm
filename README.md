Which one of them is the better one ?    
> Factors :  
> 1. Different programming Languages -> Programmer writes bad code in C run faster in fast machine  
> 2. Running on different machines  

Therefore , theoretical analysis and mathematical tools helps in determining better code , so that you do not depend upon programming language and machine. The analysis which helps in determining this is called Asymptotic Analysis.

## Big O Notation

We say f(n) = O(g(n)) iff there exists constants c and no such that f(n) <= cg(n) for all n>=no
