> Which one of them is the better one ?
> Factors :
> 1. Different programming Languages -> Programmer writes bad code in C run faster in fast machine
> 2. Running on different machines

Therefore , theoretical analysis and mathematical tools helps in determining better code , so that you do not depend upon programming language and machine. The analysis which helps in determining this is called Asymptotic Analysis.
